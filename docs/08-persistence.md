## 16. Save / load

Because state is data and behavior is referenced by name (mixins/handlers/effects in registries), the world serializes cleanly.

Strategy:

- **Serialize**: the snapshot is exactly `WorldState` (§6) — nothing else is serializable. That's entities (component maps + mixin name lists), levels (layer arrays as base64-encoded typed arrays, entity indices rebuildable), timeline state (turn order + pending delayed effects), RNG state (`pure-rand` generator state), the turn counter, and the trigger/zone store (§11A.5). Per §6.3, state holds only names; functions/services are never serialized — **including the `EngineConfig`, which is injected at load, not stored** (see the M9 note below). The envelope is encoded with **`devalue`**, which preserves the `Map`s and shared references and parses faster/smaller than the alternatives; layer grids stay as our own base64 typed-array encoding for compactness.
- **Transient (derived) layers are excluded from the save.** Some level layers are rebuildable caches, not authoritative state: the composed `flags` layer (§8.1), the shared/per-viewer `visible`/`visible:<id>` FOV layers, and the AI `field:<id>` layers. The codec **skips these on encode** and the owning services rebuild them on first `forLevel`/recompute after load; `tiles`, `explored`/`explored:<id>` (player memory), and game-authoritative sim layers (e.g. atmosphere `pressure`) persist. The newer per-level services — the **FlagIndex**, the **NetworkManager**, and per-tick **steppers** — reconstruct exactly like `fov`/`path`/`fields`: nothing of theirs is in the blob; a stepper's recurring timer round-trips by `effectId` and the game re-calls `registerStepper` after load (§7.5). `Services.flags`/`bumpInteractions` are reconstructed registries (core flags/rules re-registered by `registerCoreContent`); custom game tiles/flags must likewise be re-registered on load so the palette is rebuilt identically (the save stores tile *indices*).
- **Deserialize**: read snapshot → **validate against the save schema (§16.4)** → reconstruct `Services` from the registries → resolve component/mixin/handler/effect names → rebuild entities, indices, and the timeline. (This is the same operation `fork()` would use, minus the copy.)
- **Versioning**: snapshot carries a `schemaVersion`; a migration table (config) upgrades old saves before validation against the current schema.

```ts
interface SaveBlob { schemaVersion: number; world: SerializedWorld; }
interface Storage { save(slot: string, blob: SaveBlob): Promise<void>; load(slot: string): Promise<SaveBlob | null>; }
```

`Storage` is an adapter (localStorage, IndexedDB, file, memory). Restoring RNG state gives reproducible continuation; full run replay (recording the action stream) is a possible later add-on, enabled by the action pipeline but not in initial scope.

**Implementation notes (M9).** The public surface is `saveWorld(world): SaveBlob` / `encodeSave(world): string` and `loadWorld(raw, opts?): World`; `Storage`/`createStorage` wrap them over a structural `StorageLike` backend (so `localStorage` plugs in without pulling the DOM into the library build). Three resolved details refine the strategy above:

- **`EngineConfig` is reconstructed, not serialized.** Like services, config is injected at load (`loadWorld({ config })`, default `defaultConfig`) rather than carried in the blob — it holds content tables, not run state, and must stay function-free data. Only `WorldState` is in the blob.
- **The migration table is a load-time argument** (`loadWorld({ migrations })`), applied before validation. It is not part of `EngineConfig` (which would otherwise carry functions).
- **`Level.entityIndex` is not persisted.** The authoritative spatial index is the live `QueryIndex`; on load it is rebuilt from each entity's `Position` component, and `entityIndex` stays empty (as it is during play), keeping the round-trip symmetric.

### 16.4 Boundary validation (Zod, schema-first)

Two boundaries take data the engine didn't produce itself: **authored content** (blueprints, tile types, effect definitions) and **loaded save blobs** (possibly old or hand-edited). Both are validated with **Zod v4** at the edge — never in hot loops.

The committed rule, to avoid any duplication: **persisted/authored data types are defined as Zod schemas and their TypeScript types are inferred with `z.infer`.** The schema is the single source of truth; there is no parallel hand-written interface. This covers components (§5.1), `Blueprint`, `TileType`, status/effect definitions, and the `SaveBlob`. Runtime-only types that are never serialized (`Action`, `GameEvent`, `ActionContext`, `RenderFrame`, mixin definitions) remain plain hand-written interfaces — they don't cross a boundary, so they need no schema and get no second declaration either.

```ts
// content/validate.ts
const SaveBlob = z.object({
  schemaVersion: z.number().int(),
  world: SerializedWorld,          // composed from the component/level schemas
});
type SaveBlob = z.infer<typeof SaveBlob>;

export const parseSave = (raw: unknown): SaveBlob => SaveBlob.parse(raw);   // throws on bad data
export const parseBlueprint = (raw: unknown): Blueprint => Blueprint.parse(raw);
```

Validation runs in exactly two places: when content is registered, and inside `load()` after migration and `devalue` decoding. Everywhere else, data is already typed and trusted. To keep the shipped bundle lean, the engine imports from `zod/mini` (same schemas, smaller footprint) where the full Zod surface isn't needed.
